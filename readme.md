# Visualizing Education

## Goal
Visualize correlations of academic achievement with:

* reading
* income
* property taxes of neighborhood

interactively and in a beautiful way.

## Problem 1: Which Technologies?

d3? Or Highcharts.js?

### If d3:
    
    How to integrate with React properly?

* Victory.js
* React-d3
* React-d3-components
* React-faux-dom

## Problem 2: How to present data?

As simple bar graph? As a stepper? Through elegant scrollytelling?

For showing property tax data, an interactive map like in [this](http://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474256366/why-americas-schools-have-a-money-problem) NPR article might be nice.

For achievement with reading and income, simple graphs should work, but how to make them more exciting?
